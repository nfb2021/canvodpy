"""GNSS data-file discovery shared by the pipeline run and its dry-run preview.

One code path decides which files of a receiver are processed for a day, so
``canvodpy run --dry-run`` reports exactly the files a real run would ingest.

Each receiver's configured ``directory`` is scanned recursively once per run.
Hidden directories are skipped and symbolic links are not followed. A file's
day comes from the date in its (canonical) name, not from the folder it sits
in, so any folder layout works: all files in one folder, one folder per day
(``YYDDD`` or ``YYYYDDD``), or deeper nesting. A file belongs to the day it
starts on.

Which files count:

1. **Recipe** -- when the receiver config sets ``recipe:``, the naming recipe
   (``canvod-filemap``) selects the files and maps each to its canonical
   canVOD name. This is the only way non-canonical filenames are processed,
   and the recipe sets the receiver identity (e.g. ``ROSA01TUW``).
2. **Canonical convention** -- otherwise, only files whose names follow the
   canVOD naming convention (``canvod-preflight``) are processed, restricted
   by ``reader_format``. Compressed files are not selected, because the
   readers do not decompress. Whether ``canvod-filemap`` is installed does
   not change this.

Each receiver needs its own directory: a directory whose canonical files
belong to more than one receiver identity is an error, and so are two files
that map to the same canonical name and two files of the same type whose
named time spans overlap (e.g. a daily file next to the 15-minute files of
the same day).
