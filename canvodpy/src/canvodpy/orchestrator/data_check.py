"""Check a site's receiver data before processing it.

Used by ``canvodpy config validate``. It applies the same file discovery as
``canvodpy run`` (:mod:`canvodpy.orchestrator.discovery`), so a site that
passes the check is processed with exactly the files reported here, and
every error reported here would also stop a run. In addition it lists the
files a run does not process (a run only warns with their number per file
type), and it checks whether the named sampling interval of a file matches
that of its data.
