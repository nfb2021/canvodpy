"""Shared retry-with-backoff wrapper for Icechunk store I/O.

``icechunk.IcechunkError`` wraps object-store errors -- including transient
network drops on shared/mounted storage (os error 103 ECONNABORTED, seen in
production against an NFS-style share; dev/perf_degradation_findings_2026_
07_15.md) -- but is not a subclass of OSError/RuntimeError/ValueError, so it
escapes a plain ``except (OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError)`` uncaught.
Used by both the RINEX ingest path (``orchestrator/pipeline.py``) and the
VOD store write path (``cli/run.py``) -- both hit the same store, over the
same network mount, so both need the same retry treatment.
