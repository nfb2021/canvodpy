    Used by ``canvodpy store maintain-due`` (a cron-safe, non-interactive
    entry point for scheduled Icechunk expiration/GC) to defend against
    running maintenance concurrently with an active pipeline write -- both
    are explicitly documented as unsafe to overlap (see
    ``MyIcechunkStore.maintenance()``'s docstring). Same-host only: this

    network-mounted (CIFS/NFS) store -- that case must be kept apart by
    the operator (e.g. scheduling maintenance in a known-idle window).

    Liveness is checked via the recorded PID, not just the file's
    existence, so a stale file left behind by a hard crash (SIGKILL, OOM)
    correctly reads as "not running" without needing separate stale-lock
    cleanup.
