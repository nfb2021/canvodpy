# canvodpy: instructions for coding agents

canvodpy computes vegetation optical depth (VOD) from GNSS signals: a
receiver below a canopy and a reference receiver with open sky
(GNSS-Transmissometry, GNSS-T). It reads receiver files (RINEX, SBF),
adds satellite geometry, assigns hemisphere grid cells, computes VOD and
keeps everything in versioned Icechunk stores. Its users are scientists.

`CLAUDE.md` files only import this file; edit `AGENTS.md`. Every package
has its own `AGENTS.md`: read it before changing that package.

## Scientific context

Read before changing scientific logic.

- **GNSS-T.** The same satellite signal (L-band) is received below the
  canopy and at the reference. The canopy weakens it; the ratio of the
  signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) gives the transmissivity T.
- **VOD** (zeroth-order tau-omega model): `VOD = -ln(T) · cos(θ)`, θ the
  polar angle of the satellite (0 = overhead, 90° = horizon). VOD tracks
  vegetation water content and biomass. L-band passes through the whole
  canopy, unlike optical indices.

| Concept | Meaning | In the code |
|---|---|---|
| SNR | Signal-to-noise ratio, dB-Hz, the observable VOD uses | data variable `SNR`; SBF quantizes to 0.25 dB |
| SID | Signal ID `SV\|band\|code`, e.g. `G01\|L1\|C` | dimension `sid`; one satellite has many SIDs |
| θ, φ | Polar angle and azimuth of the satellite, seen from the receiver | `theta`, `phi`, radians; the code prefers polar angle over elevation |
| Ephemeris | Satellite orbits: agency final products (SP3/CLK) or the receiver's broadcast navigation data (SBF) | canvod-auxiliary |
| Epoch | Observation time; each reader records its time scale | coordinate `epoch`, `epoch.attrs["time_system"]` |
| Hemisphere grid | Cells of the sky seen from the receiver; equal-area is the default | canvod-grids |

## Project architecture

Processing chain, one receiver-day at a time:

```
files (RINEX/SBF) -> reader -> Dataset(epoch, sid)
  -> satellite geometry (SP3/CLK or broadcast) -> theta, phi
  -> optional preprocessing (only if set in the settings)
  -> observation store (Icechunk) -> VOD (canopy vs reference) -> VOD store
```

| Package | Import | Role | Read first |
|---|---|---|---|
| canvodpy | `canvodpy` | CLI, `Site`/`Pipeline`, orchestrator, Airflow tasks, VOD computation | `canvodpy/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-readers | `canvod.readers` | RINEX v2/v3, SBF, NMEA readers; the dataset contracts | `packages/canvod-readers/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-auxiliary | `canvod.auxiliary` | Ephemerides, clocks, interpolation, receiver position, θ/φ | `packages/canvod-auxiliary/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-grids | `canvod.grids` | Hemisphere grids, cell assignment, grid analysis | `packages/canvod-grids/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-ops | `canvod.ops` | Optional preprocessing (temporal aggregation, grid assignment) | `packages/canvod-ops/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-vod | `canvod.vod` | VOD calculators | `packages/canvod-vod/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-store | `canvod.store` | Icechunk stores: writes, dedup, maintenance | `packages/canvod-store/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-store-metadata | `canvod.store_metadata` | DataCite/ACDD/STAC metadata of a store | `packages/canvod-store-metadata/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-config | `canvod.config` | Settings models and the settings file loader | `packages/canvod-config/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-preflight | `canvod.preflight` | The canonical file name convention | `packages/canvod-preflight/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-utils | `canvod.utils` | Dates, file hashes, deprecation decorator, logging context | `packages/canvod-utils/AGENTS.md` |
| canvod-viz | `canvod.viz` | 2D/3D hemisphere plots | `packages/canvod-viz/AGENTS.md` |

All packages share one `.venv` at the root (uv workspace). `canvod` is a
namespace package: the `canvod` folder under each `src` has no init
module. Lower packages never import `canvodpy`
(`canvodpy/tests/test_package_boundaries.py` checks this).

### Entry points: one way to process data

| Entry point | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CLI: `canvodpy run --site ... --start ... --end ...` | `canvodpy/src/canvodpy/cli/run.py` | recommended |
| Python: `Site(site).pipeline()` | `canvodpy/src/canvodpy/api.py` | same code as the CLI |
| Airflow: `check_day`, `process_day` | `canvodpy/src/canvodpy/workflows/tasks.py` | same code as the CLI, called by canvod-airflow |

All three find files through `canvodpy/src/canvodpy/orchestrator/discovery.py`
and compute VOD with `VodComputer` (`canvodpy/src/canvodpy/vod_computer.py`).
Deprecated, still working until v2.0.0, never recommended: `FluentWorkflow`,
`process_date()`/`calculate_vod()`/`preview_processing()`, `VODWorkflow`,
`canvodpy.functional`, the per-format Airflow tasks. Details in
`docs/guides/api-levels.md`.

### Data contracts

The code is the truth; don't copy the constants into new code.

- Observation datasets: `validate_dataset` in
  `packages/canvod-readers/src/canvod/readers/base.py` (dims `(epoch, sid)`,
  required coordinates, `SNR`, attribute `"File Hash"`).
- VOD datasets: `validate_vod_dataset` in the same file (`VOD`, `theta`,
  `phi` in radians); the VOD store refuses anything else.
- File names: `CanVODFilename` in
  `packages/canvod-preflight/src/canvod/preflight/convention.py`, e.g.
  `ROSA01TUW_R_20250010000_15M_05S_AA.rnx`. Other names need a naming
  recipe (canvod-filemap).

### canvodpy-extensions

Optional packages in a separate repository
(<https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy-extensions>), GitHub-only:
canvod-filemap (naming recipes), canvod-airflow (DAGs), canvod-adapters
(exchange with other GNSS-T programs). canvodpy installs canvod-filemap as
the workspace dependency group `filemap` (`uv sync --group filemap`).
The extensions import canvodpy's contracts and `canvodpy.workflows.tasks`.
Before renaming or changing anything public, search the extensions for it
and plan their change too; their agent instructions are
[`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy-extensions/blob/main/AGENTS.md). See the `extensions-dependency` guide.

## Task guides

Step-by-step guides for recurring tasks. Claude Code loads them as skills;
other agents read the files directly.

| Task | Guide |
|---|---|
| Run the pipeline, or help a user run it | `.claude/skills/run-pipeline/SKILL.md` |
| Add a reader for a new file format | `.claude/skills/add-reader/SKILL.md` |
| Add a GNSS constellation | `.claude/skills/add-constellation/SKILL.md` |
| Deprecate code | `.claude/skills/deprecate/SKILL.md` |
| Write to, repair or maintain a store safely | `.claude/skills/store-safety/SKILL.md` |
| Icechunk 2 API (sessions, fork/merge, maintenance) | `.claude/skills/icechunk/SKILL.md` |
| Change what canvodpy takes from canvodpy-extensions | `.claude/skills/extensions-dependency/SKILL.md` |
| Release canvodpy | `.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md` |

## Development workflow

1. Work on a branch, never on `main`. Every change reaches `main` through
   a PR.
2. Read the `AGENTS.md` of every package you change, and the task guide if
   one fits.
3. Change code and tests together. A bug fix gets a test that failed
   before the fix.
4. Same PR: the package docs under `docs/packages/<package>/` and the
   `AGENTS.md` files, wherever the change makes them wrong.
5. Verify: `just check`, then `just test-package <package>` (or
   `just test-fast`, `just test`). Report failures; don't skip tests.
6. Commit in conventional form, scope = package or area:
   `fix(readers): ...`, `feat(store): ...`, `refactor(orchestrator): ...`.
   Mark breaking changes (`feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer).

Running on real data or writing to a production store needs the user's
go-ahead first.

## Commands

```bash
just sync                             # all packages, one .venv, git hooks
uv sync --group filemap               # plus canvod-filemap (naming recipes)
just check                            # ruff lint + format, ty, agent docs
just test-fast                        # tests without the integration marker
just test                             # all tests
just test-package canvod-readers      # one package
just docs                             # preview the docs site
just doctor                           # version, environment, settings found
just config-validate                  # check the settings file
```

Pre-commit runs ruff, `uv lock`, whitespace checks and the agent docs
check; commitizen checks the commit message; the pre-push hook runs ty. CI runs lint, format, ty and
the agent docs check (`.github/workflows/code_quality.yml`) and the tests
on Linux, macOS and Windows (`.github/workflows/test_platforms.yml`).

## Finding code: the code graph

A graph of the code (graphify, built from the syntax tree, local and free)
answers structural questions faster and more completely than grep.

| Question | Command |
|---|---|
| What calls, imports or subclasses `NAME`; what does a change to it affect? | `just graph-affected NAME` |
| What does `NAME` connect to, in both directions? | `just graph-explain NAME` |
| How does `A` reach `B`? | `just graph-path A B` (caller first) |

- **Use it before changing code**: before renaming, deprecating or
  changing the behavior of anything, list its callers with
  `just graph-affected`. Before writing new code, look for an existing
  implementation (`graph-explain` on the nearest name you know), so no
  second one appears.
- **Verify what it says.** Edges marked `EXTRACTED` come from the syntax
  tree; `INFERRED` edges are guesses. Read the code before relying on one.
  For finding code by words, grep is better.
- **Freshness**: git hooks rebuild it in the background after every
  commit, merge and checkout (`.graphify/build.log`). After larger edits
  that are not committed yet (renames, moves, deletions), run `just graph`
  (about 10 s) before using it again. If the graph is missing, run
  `just graph`.
- It covers this repository only; search canvodpy-extensions separately.

## Rules

- **Free tools only.** Nothing in this project may need a paid service or
  API key: not for building, testing, docs or agent tooling. graphify can
  call paid language models; use it only through the `just graph*`
  recipes, never `graphify label`, a full `graphify extract`, or its
  assistant skill.

- **Explicit over implicit.** Fail loudly with a message that says what to
  do. No silent fallback, no hidden default: a default in a signature or a
  documented settings model is fine; library code reading the settings file
  behind the caller's back, or `except Exception` falling back to a value,
  is not. Entry points (CLI, `Site`) read the settings and pass them down.
- **One implementation per job.** Before writing something, find the code
  that already does it and reuse it. Two code paths that do the same job
  drift apart and give different results.
- **Composition over inheritance.** Pass collaborators in; inherit only
  from pydantic models and from ABC interfaces. Interfaces are ABCs, not
  duck typing.
- **Deprecate, don't delete.** Public code that goes away gets the
  deprecation decorator and stays until v2.0.0; see the `deprecate` guide.
  Delete outright only when the user says so.
- **Optional processing stays optional.** Preprocessing from
  `processing.preprocessing` runs in every run when set and never by
  default.
- **Write for scientists.** Names, messages, CLI help and docs use clear,
  unambiguous words.

## Guardrails

Scientific correctness and data integrity. Understand the science before
changing these, and run `just test-fast` afterwards.

- VOD formula: `packages/canvod-vod/src/canvod/vod/calculator.py`
- Coordinate transforms and ephemeris interpolation:
  `packages/canvod-auxiliary/src/canvod/auxiliary/position/`,
  `packages/canvod-auxiliary/src/canvod/auxiliary/interpolation/`
- Epoch grid: 00:00 plus multiples of the sampling interval
  (`packages/canvod-auxiliary/src/canvod/auxiliary/interpolation/day_grid.py`)
- SID construction: must match across readers and stores
  (`packages/canvod-readers/src/canvod/readers/builder.py`)
- Store dedup and write strategies: `packages/canvod-store/AGENTS.md`
- File name convention: `packages/canvod-preflight/src/canvod/preflight/convention.py`

## Key documentation: the breadcrumb trail

For more context than this file gives, read in this order:

1. `docs/architecture.md`: packages, layers, the processing flow
2. `docs/principles.md`: design principles, the file name convention
3. `docs/guides/api-levels.md`: CLI and `Site.pipeline()`, deprecated surfaces
4. `docs/guides/configuration.md`: the settings file
5. `docs/guides/getting-started.md`: setup and a first run
6. `docs/packages/naming/overview.md`: which files a run processes, naming recipes
7. `docs/guides/extensions.md`: the optional packages
8. `docs/packages/`: one folder per package, start at its overview page

When a user asks to explain the project, walk them through this trail.
Before answering about an unfamiliar package, read its `AGENTS.md` and
its overview page under `docs/packages/`. `docs/guides/ai-development.md` explains this setup to
people.

## Keeping these files useful

- Write what an agent cannot see quickly in the code: decisions,
  invariants, traps, where things live. Don't list functions or restate
  docstrings; point at the file that holds the truth.
- Name the `just` recipe whenever one does the job, not the raw command
  behind it: agents and users must run the same thing and get the same
  result. If no recipe fits a recurring task, add one rather than
  documenting a command.
- Every path and `just` recipe named in `AGENTS.md` files and the guides
  must exist: `just check-agent-docs` verifies this (pre-commit and CI).
  Write paths in canvodpy-extensions as `extensions:<path>`; they are
  checked at the locked canvod-filemap commit when a canvodpy-extensions
  checkout is next to this repository (or at `$CANVODPY_EXTENSIONS_REPO`),
  and always in CI.
- When a change makes a statement here wrong, fix it in the same PR.
