# Configuration Guide

## Why canVODpy needs a configuration file

Most scientific Python packages work immediately after installation. Opposed to that, canVODpy manages a long-running, multi-file, multi-site data pipeline that
produces versioned scientific stores. Some things cannot be inferred from the code:

- **Where your data lives** — file paths differ on every machine, HPC cluster, or deployment.
- **Who you are** — your name, institution, and ORCID are written into the Icechunk store's
  provenance metadata for reproducibility and FAIR compliance.
- **How much compute to use** — a laptop and a 64-core server require different resource
  limits. canVODpy defaults to an automatic mode; you can override this for your hardware.

Everything else, SID filtering, chunk strategies, aggregation parameters, ships with defaults, but can be tuned according to your needs.

Configuration is validated by
[pydantic-settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/).
Every field is type-checked at load time: a typo in a field name, or a string where a number
belongs, is reported immediately with the exact location.

## Configuration commands

```bash
# Setup
just config-init                       # scaffold canvod-settings.yaml from template
just config-edit                       # open canvod-settings.yaml in $EDITOR
just config-delete                     # delete canvod-settings.yaml (requires typed confirmation)

# Verification
just config-validate                   # validate config against Pydantic models
just config-show                       # print the fully resolved config (see note below)
just config-check-data <site>          # validate file names in all receiver directories
```

`just config-show` prints the **fully resolved** configuration. Any value set via environment
variable (see [Environment variable overrides](#environment-variable-overrides) below) is shown
as the effective value — not the YAML value it supersedes. This is the authoritative way to
confirm what canVODpy will actually use at runtime.

---

## Overlay config file

For deployment-specific overrides — different store paths on a cluster, a CI environment,
a shared server — use an overlay file instead of modifying `canvod-settings.yaml`.

Pass `--config` to any command that accepts it:

```bash
# Inspect or validate with an overlay applied
canvodpy config --config cluster-overlay.yaml validate
canvodpy config --config cluster-overlay.yaml show

# Run the pipeline with an overlay
uv run canvodpy run --site mysite --start 2025001 --end 2025028 \
    --config cluster-overlay.yaml
```

Only the fields present in the overlay are changed; everything else is read from the main file.

### Overlays can only add or override — never delete

The overlay is merged **on top of** the base `canvod-settings.yaml`; it can add new keys or
override existing ones, but it cannot remove a key that exists in the base file. If your base
file defines a site (or any other field) that isn't mentioned in the overlay, that entry stays
in the resolved config no matter what the overlay contains.

!!! warning "Common trap: the scaffolded placeholder site"

    `canvod-settings.yaml` (from `just config-init`) ships with a live, uncommented `my_site:`
    placeholder under `sites:` — meant to be **renamed** to your real site, not kept alongside
    it. If you added your real site as a new block instead of renaming the placeholder,
    `my_site` is still there with unreachable paths like `/path/to/your/gnss/data/my_site` —
    and `config validate` / `run` will fail on it, since no overlay can delete it, only the
    base file itself can.

    Fix: edit the base `canvod-settings.yaml` directly and remove the leftover placeholder
    site under `sites:`. If the base file has accumulated enough cruft that starting over is
    easier, `just config-delete` removes it (with a typed confirmation, since this is
    destructive) so you can `just config-init` fresh.

---

## File layout

```
config/
└── canvod-settings.yaml          # unified configuration (processing, sites, sids)
```

**Precedence:** environment variable > overlay file (`--config`) > `canvod-settings.yaml` > package defaults.

Only the fields you want to change need to be written — everything else falls back to package
defaults. Unknown field names are rejected throughout the config tree (`extra="forbid"`),
so typos surface at load time rather than causing silent misconfiguration.

Two environment variables control *where* configuration is read from:

| Variable             | Effect                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CANVOD_CONFIG_DIR`  | Use a different config directory, for the settings file and the recipes; same as the `--config-dir` option (default: `config/` of a canvodpy checkout, else `~/.config/canvodpy`) |
| `CANVOD_CONFIG_FILE` | Apply an overlay YAML on top of the main `canvod-settings.yaml`  |

---

## Environment variable overrides

Any configuration value can be overridden without editing the file by setting an environment
variable with the `CANVOD__` prefix, using double underscores (`__`) to separate nesting
levels. This is particularly useful on HPC clusters and shared servers, where resource limits
vary per job but the configuration file is version-controlled:

```bash
CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__N_MAX_THREADS=4 \
    uv run canvodpy run --site mysite
CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__DAYS_PER_BATCH=7 \
    uv run canvodpy run --site mysite
```

!!! warning "This must stay one shell command"

    `VAR=value` set on its own line (without `export`) only exists in your *current*
    shell — it is never passed down to `canvodpy`, a separate process. The `\` above
    is a line continuation: it keeps `VAR=value` and the command that follows as a
    single shell statement. Do not press Enter after the `VAR=value` line and then
    run the command separately — that sets a local variable and silently does
    nothing.

    Two ways to avoid the trap:

    ```bash
    # inline, one line, no backslash needed:
    CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__DAYS_PER_BATCH=7 uv run canvodpy run --site mysite

    # or export it once, then reuse it across multiple commands:
    export CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__DAYS_PER_BATCH=7
    just config-show   # confirms the override took effect
    uv run canvodpy run --site mysite
    ```

Scalar values (strings, integers, booleans) are passed as-is. List values require JSON
encoding:

```bash
CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__KEEP_GNSS_OBSERVABLES='["SNR","Pseudorange"]' \
    uv run canvodpy run --site mysite
```

Some examples, but really all configuration fields can be overwritten:

| Variable                                                   | Overrides                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `CANVOD__PROCESSING__STORAGE__STORES_ROOT_DIR`             | `processing.storage.stores_root_dir`             |
| `CANVOD__PROCESSING__CREDENTIALS__NASA_EARTHDATA_ACC_MAIL` | `processing.credentials.nasa_earthdata_acc_mail` |
| `CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__N_MAX_THREADS`                | `processing.params.n_max_threads`                |

Environment variables take priority over all other sources. To confirm the effective value,
run `just config-show` — if `CANVOD__PROCESSING__PARAMS__N_MAX_THREADS=4` is set in the
environment, the output will show `n_max_threads: 4` regardless of what the YAML file says.

## Minimal working example

A complete, valid `canvod-settings.yaml` requires only a handful of fields — everything
else is covered by package defaults:

### Key fields

| Field                           | Values                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `params.keep_gnss_observables`  | list                     | GNSS observables to retain (default `[SNR]`).                                                                                                                                            |
| `params.rinex_v3_parser`        | `validated`, `unvalidated_fast` | How RINEX v3 files are parsed. `validated` (default) checks every epoch and drops (and logs) epochs that fail. `unvalidated_fast` is **dangerous**: no checks, corrupted records can enter the store, and the results are entirely your responsibility; every use emits an `UnvalidatedParserWarning`. Both give the identical dataset for a valid file. |
| `params.receiver_position_mode` | `shared`, `per_receiver` | `shared` uses canopy receiver position for all receivers (enables 1:1 SNR comparison). `per_receiver` uses each receiver's own position.                                                 |
| `params.file_pairing`           | `complete`, `paired`     | `complete` ingests all files per receiver independently. `paired` only processes dates where both receivers have data.                                                                   |
| `params.ephemeris_source`       | `final`, `broadcast`     | `final` computes satellite positions from agency SP3/CLK products. `broadcast` uses the satellite angles the receiver computed from the broadcast ephemeris (SBF SatVisibility blocks; almanac-based angles are not used; SBF only, no SP3/CLK download, faster but less accurate). |
| `aux_data.fetch_clock`          | `true`, `false`          | Whether to download and interpolate CLK clock-correction files alongside SP3 (only applies to `ephemeris_source: final`). Default `true`. VOD doesn't consume clock data — disable to save downloads/parsing/interpolation time. |
| `params.days_per_batch`         | 1–30                     | Calendar days pooled per parallel processing wave.                                                                                                                                       |
| `params.resource_mode`          | `auto`, `manual`         | `auto` detects available CPU cores and leaves two free for the operating system. `manual` enforces explicit limits (`n_max_threads` is then required) — use this on shared servers.      |
| `params.store_radial_distance`  | `true`, `false`          | Whether to store satellite radial distance in the output.                                                                                                                                |
| `params.store_sbf_raw_observables` | `true`, `false`       | SBF only: add the pre-correction observables (`SNR_raw`, `Pseudorange_unsmoothed`, `Pseudorange_raw`, `Phase_raw`) to the observations. Default `true`. |
| `params.store_sbf_metadata`     | `true`, `false`          | SBF only: store the per-file metadata dataset `sbf_obs` (SatVisibility geometry, MeasExtra, PVT, DOP, receiver status) under `{group}/metadata/sbf_obs`, in the same commit as the observations. Default `true`. |
| `storage.gnss_store_strategy`   | `skip`, `overwrite`, `unsafe_append` | What to do when a file already exists in the store. `skip` (default) is the normal case. See warning below before ever using `unsafe_append`.                              |

For a full explanation of how `resource_mode`, `days_per_batch`, and `n_max_threads` interact
with the parallel processing architecture, see
[Parallel Processing](parallel-processing.md).

!!! warning "`gnss_store_strategy: unsafe_append` can corrupt unguarded reads"
    `skip` (the default) is a no-op when a file already exists — the correct behavior for
    the normal workflow of chronologically filling an initially-empty store, where a
    re-run over already-ingested files should change nothing. `overwrite` deletes the old
    epochs for a file's range before writing the replacement — use it after a *pipeline*
    bug fix (reader logic, ephemeris source) when you need to regenerate previously-stored
    results, not because the raw GNSS file itself changed.

    `unsafe_append` writes the file's data again on top of what's already there, with **no
    epoch-level uniqueness check**, producing duplicate `epoch` coordinate values in the
    Zarr array. The two built-in pipeline read paths already guard against this:
    `GnssResearchSite.read_receiver_data()` routes through `read_group_deduplicated()`
    whenever this strategy is set, and `VodComputer.compute_bulk()` unconditionally
    deduplicates every read via `_dedup_sort()` regardless of strategy. But
    `MyIcechunkStore.read_group()` itself — the low-level API used directly by custom
    scripts/notebooks, and by the deprecated L1 `Pipeline.calculate_vod()` — has no such
    guard: `.sel()` on a duplicated label can raise or silently return multiple matches,
    and aligning two datasets that both carry the duplicate (e.g. canopy vs. reference)
    produces a cartesian product at those epochs. The duplication is also physical, not
    just a read-time artifact: Icechunk stores the extra chunks permanently regardless of
    whether the read side protects against it. Avoid `unsafe_append` unless you have a
    specific reason, and be aware any read path outside the two guarded ones above is
    unprotected.

### Ephemeris data sources

Agency SP3/CLK products are downloaded from **ESA GSSC** — no account or credentials
are required. Setting `credentials.nasa_earthdata_acc_mail` to the email address of a
(free) NASA Earthdata account adds **NASA CDDIS** as a fallback, used when ESA GSSC
fails.

---

## sites:

Defines research sites, their receivers, and VOD analysis pairs.
Each top-level key under `sites:` is a site name — there is no additional `sites:` nesting.

```yaml
sites:
  my_site:
    gnss_site_data_root: /data/my_site
    description: null        # optional free-text description
    country: null            # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, e.g. AT
    latitude: null           # WGS84 decimal degrees
    longitude: null
    altitude_m: null         # metres above WGS84 ellipsoid

    receivers:
      reference_01:
        type: reference
        directory: 01_reference
        reader_format: auto           # auto, rinex3, rinex3_stripped, rinex2, sbf, nmea
        paired_canopies: all          # 'all' or list of canopy receiver names
      canopy_01:
        type: canopy
        directory: 02_canopy
        reader_format: auto

    vod_analyses:
      canopy_01_vs_reference_01:
        canopy_receiver: canopy_01
        reference_receiver: reference_01
```

### Receiver fields

| Field             | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`            | --      | `reference` or `canopy`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `directory`       | --      | Subdirectory under `gnss_site_data_root` holding this receiver's files.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `reader_format`   | `auto`  | Reader for the receiver's files: `rinex3`, `rinex3_stripped` (signal strengths only, faster), `rinex2`, `sbf`, `nmea`. `auto` detects it per day: SBF and NMEA by file type, RINEX 2 or 3 from the header. A day whose files need different readers stops the run with an error; then set the reader, or keep each format in its own directory. A canopy receiver and its reference must record the same file format (`rinex3` and `rinex3_stripped` both read RINEX 3); mixed formats are rejected when the settings load, or, with `auto`, by `canvodpy config validate` and at the start of a run. |
| `paired_canopies` | --      | Which canopy receivers this reference is paired with: `all` or a list of canopy receiver names. Required for reference receivers, must not be set for canopy receivers. (The old name `scs_from` is deprecated and still accepted with a warning.) |

---

## sids:

Controls which satellite signal IDs (SIDs) are retained during processing.
Three modes are available:

| Mode     | Behaviour                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `all`    | Keep every SID observed in the file — no filtering |
| `preset` | Use a named built-in list (see below)              |
| `custom` | Keep only the SIDs you list explicitly             |

=== "Default preset"

    The package ships one built-in preset: `default` — a curated 271-SID
    multi-GNSS list covering MEO satellites only (GPS + Galileo + BeiDou MEO +
    GLONASS). GEO, IGSO, augmentation signals (SBAS/IRNSS/QZSS), and GPS L2W are
    excluded because they are not useful for canopy transmissometry.

    The list names PRNs, and PRNs are reassigned to other satellites over
    time. BeiDou C13 and C16 are left out: both were IGSO satellites until
    2026-04-18 (IGS satellite metadata), and C13 is a MEO satellite from
    2026-04-19 on. For data from 2026-04-19 on, add the C13 SIDs with
    `mode: custom` if you want them. `SatelliteCatalog` shows which satellite
    held a PRN on a given day ([Satellite Catalog](../packages/readers/satellite-catalog.md)).
    All are RINEX 3 signals. RINEX 2 band-only SIDs (e.g. `L1|u`) are not
    included and must be selected explicitly, see
    [RINEX v2.11 Parsing](../packages/readers/rinex-v2-format.md#default-sid-preset).

    ```yaml
    sids:
      mode: preset
      preset: default
    ```

    This is the **package default**. Use `mode: all` to opt out and keep every observed SID.

=== "All signals"

    ```yaml
    sids:
      mode: all
    ```

=== "Custom list"

    ```yaml
    sids:
      mode: custom
      custom_sids:
        - "G01|L1|C"
        - "E01|E1|C"
    ```

The `default` preset is reviewed and updated at every release to reflect satellite launches,
decommissions, and orbit reclassifications. See the [release procedure](../../RELEASING.md)
for details.

## Validating configuration and data

Validation runs in two distinct steps — one for the configuration file, one for the data
directories it references.

**Config validation** runs `canvod-settings.yaml` through the Pydantic models and reports
field errors (wrong types, missing required values, unknown keys), then checks that each
receiver directory exists and contains data files:

```bash
just config-validate
```

**Data check** finds each receiver's files exactly as `canvodpy run` does, in any folder
layout, and reports the days and files a run would process, files it would pass over,
and problems that would stop it (for example two files covering the same time):

```bash
just config-check-data <site>
```

## Optional: non-canonical filenames

!!! warning "This deviates from the community-agreed GNSS-T file naming convention"
    The standard pipeline expects every GNSS data file to follow the
    [community-agreed  filename convention](../packages/naming/overview.md),
    and processes only files that follow it.

    If your receiver outputs files in a proprietary or legacy format —
    Septentrio SBF with firmware-generated names, RINEX v2 short names,
    or a custom directory layout — the optional
    [`canvod-filemap`](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy-extensions) package
    provides a recipe-based mapping layer that translates physical filenames to
    canonical names **without renaming anything on disk**.

    Recipes are an escape hatch for non-conforming data, not the intended workflow.
    Where possible, rename files to the canonical convention using `gfzrnx` as a
    one-time per-site step.

In a canvodpy checkout, install it with `uv sync --group filemap`. Elsewhere,
install it from the [canvodpy-extensions](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy-extensions)
repository on GitHub; see [Optional Extensions](extensions.md).

Reference a recipe from `canvod-settings.yaml` on the receiver whose files use non-canonical names:

```yaml
sites:
  my_site:
    receivers:
      reference_01:
        recipe: my_site_reference   # → <config dir>/recipes/my_site/my_site_reference.yaml
```

Recipe files are kept per site, in `<config dir>/recipes/<site>/<recipe>.yaml`.
`just naming-init my_site my_site_reference` creates one from the template that
ships with canvod-filemap. A recipe saved directly in `<config dir>/recipes/` is
not used; the error message says where to move it. Recipes are user data and are
not part of the canvodpy repository. The full recipe format and API are documented in the
[canvod-filemap repository](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy-extensions).
