# Development Guide

Quick reference for day-to-day canVODpy development.

---

## Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy.git
cd canvodpy
git submodule update --init --recursive   # test data + demo data
uv sync                                    # install all packages (editable)
just hooks                                 # install pre-commit hooks
just test                                  # verify everything works
```

!!! info "Submodules"
    Two data repositories are pulled as submodules:

    - **`packages/canvod-readers/tests/test_data`** — falsified/corrupted RINEX files for validation tests
    - **`demo`** — clean real-world data for demos and documentation

    Tests that depend on these datasets are automatically skipped if submodules are not initialised.

## Prerequisites

Two tools must be installed outside `uv`:

| Tool | Install | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **uv** | `brew install uv` | Python + dependency management |
| **just** | `brew install just` | Task runner |

```bash
just check-dev-tools   # verify both are present
```

## Configuration Management

canVODpy uses three YAML files in `config/`:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `processing:` | Processing parameters, NASA Earthdata credentials, storage strategies, Icechunk config |
| `sites:` | Research sites, receiver definitions, data root paths, VOD analysis pairs |
| `sids:` | Signal ID filtering — `all`, a named `preset`, or `custom` list |

All three sections live in a single `config/canvod-settings.yaml`. Template: `config/canvod-settings.yaml.example`.

=== "First-time setup"

    ```bash
    canvodpy config init                # scaffold canvod-settings.yaml from template
    # edit config/canvod-settings.yaml (or: canvodpy config init --interactive)
    canvodpy config validate            # check for errors
    canvodpy config show                # print resolved config
    ```

=== "Daily use"

    ```bash
    just config-validate    # after editing
    just config-show        # inspect current values
    canvodpy doctor         # environment + config diagnostics when something's off
    ```

---

## Testing

```bash
just test                            # all tests
just test-package canvod-readers     # specific package
just test-coverage                   # with HTML coverage report
```

Tests live in `packages/<pkg>/tests/`. Integration tests are marked
`@pytest.mark.integration` and excluded from the default run.

---

## Code Quality

```bash
just check          # lint + format + type-check (run before committing)
just check-lint     # ruff linting only
just check-format   # ruff formatting only
```

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **ruff** | Linting + formatting (replaces flake8, black, isort) |
| **ty** | Type checking (replaces mypy) |
| **pytest** | Testing with coverage |

---

## Logging — add it generously

canvodpy runs unattended on remote machines. When something goes wrong
there, whatever you logged is the *only* evidence that will ever exist —
there's no attaching a debugger to a cron job after the fact. Log more than
feels necessary, especially around: file I/O, external calls (downloads,
Icechunk writes), anything with a fallback/degraded path, and any place a
silent skip could hide data loss. See `docs/guides/diagnostics.md` for the
full picture (two-track logging, `run_id`, crash handling, `stage_timer`,
the performance dashboard) — this section is the short "how do I add a log
line" version.

**Which logger to use:**

```python
# Inside the canvodpy package itself:
from canvodpy.logging import get_logger
log = get_logger(__name__)

# Inside a lower-level package that must not depend on canvodpy
# (canvod-vod, canvod-grids, canvod-ops, ...):
import structlog
log = structlog.get_logger(__name__)
```

Both are equivalent at runtime — `canvodpy.logging.get_logger` is a
one-line passthrough to `structlog.get_logger`, kept only as the documented
entry point for canvodpy's own code. `configure_logging()` installs
structlog's processor chain *globally*, so **any** `structlog.get_logger()`
call anywhere in the process — regardless of which package it's in —
automatically gets routed through the two-track logging setup (human/agent
files) with `run_id` injected, with zero per-call-site wiring. Never
reach for `print()` or stdlib `logging` directly.

**Event style:** first positional arg is a short `snake_case` event name,
everything else is a structured keyword, not string interpolation:

```python
# Good
log.info("rinex_preprocessing_started", file=str(rnx_file.name), site=site_name)
log.warning("sids_dropped_no_ephemeris", count=len(dropped), sids=sorted(dropped))

# Avoid — loses structure, can't be grepped/filtered on a field
log.info(f"Started preprocessing {rnx_file.name} for {site_name}")
```

**Timing:** use `stage_timer()`/`timed_stage()` from `canvodpy.logging`
rather than hand-rolling `t0 = time.perf_counter(); ...; duration = ...` —
it emits the canonical `stage_timing` event the performance dashboard
reads, and still emits (with `status="error"`) if the block raises.

```python
from canvodpy.logging import stage_timer

with stage_timer("icechunk.write", group=group_name, size_mb=size_mb):
    to_icechunk(dataset, session, group=group_name)
```

Only reach for a manual timing pattern when a block already has several
distinct sequential checkpoints worth logging individually with their own
rich context (see `_preprocess_aux_data_with_hermite` in `processor.py` for
an example) — those specific, well-named events are more useful than
forcing everything through one generic name.

## Keeping Your Fork in Sync

If you are working from a fork (rather than a direct clone), periodically pull updates from the upstream repository:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Then update your feature branch:
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
```

If `upstream` is not configured, add it once:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:nfb2021/canvodpy.git
```

## Pre-Commit Hooks

`just hooks` installs Git hooks that run **automatically on every commit**. If any hook fails, the commit is rejected — your changes stay staged but no commit is created.

### What runs

| Hook | Stage | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| **ruff check --fix** | `pre-commit` | Lints and auto-fixes Python code |
| **ruff format** | `pre-commit` | Formats Python code |
| **uv-lock** | `pre-commit` | Verifies `uv.lock` matches `pyproject.toml` |
| **trailing-whitespace** | `pre-commit` | Strips trailing whitespace |
| **check-added-large-files** | `pre-commit` | Blocks large files from being committed |
| **detect-private-key** | `pre-commit` | Prevents accidental secret commits |
| **end-of-file-fixer** | `pre-commit` | Ensures files end with one newline |
| **commitizen** | `commit-msg` | Validates Conventional Commits format |

### When your commit is rejected

```bash
# Most common: ruff auto-fixed your code. Stage the fixes and retry:
git add -u && git commit -m "feat(readers): your message"

# If commitizen rejects your message, use the correct format:
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
# types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci
# scopes: readers, aux, grids, vod, store, viz, utils, naming, ops, docs, ci, deps

# If uv-lock is out of date:
uv sync && git add uv.lock && git commit -m "feat(readers): your message"
```

## Contributing Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# … make changes in packages/<pkg>/src/ …
# … add tests in packages/<pkg>/tests/ …
just check && just test
git add packages/<pkg>/src/... packages/<pkg>/tests/...
git commit -m "feat(readers): add RINEX 4.0 support"
git push origin feature/my-feature
# → open pull request on GitHub
```

### Conventional Commit Scopes

`readers` · `aux` · `grids` · `vod` · `store` · `viz` · `utils` · `naming` · `ops` · `docs` · `ci` · `deps`

---

## Continuous Integration

Every push and PR triggers GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| **Code Quality** | ruff lint, ruff format, ty type-check, lockfile consistency |
| **Test with Coverage** | pytest → coverage.lcov → [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/nfb2021/canvodpy) |
| **Platform Tests** | Multi-OS, multi-Python-version test matrix |

Coverage reports are posted as PR comments and tracked on Coveralls over time. To run coverage locally:

```bash
just test-coverage    # generates HTML report
```

## Private or Local Add-on Packages

You may want to develop an add-on package alongside canVODpy that is not part
of the public repository — for example, a private algorithm, a site-specific
extension, or an experimental module you are not yet ready to publish.

The recommended pattern keeps the public workspace and lock file clean while
letting you use the package locally without friction.

### The pattern

**1. Place the package inside `packages/`**

```
packages/
  canvod-myprivatepackage/
    pyproject.toml
    src/
      canvod/myprivatepackage/
```

**2. Add it to `.gitignore`** (so it is never accidentally committed)

```
packages/canvod-myprivatepackage
```

**3. Exclude it from the uv workspace** in the root `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members  = ["packages/*", "canvodpy"]
exclude  = ["packages/canvod-myprivatepackage"]
```

This keeps `uv.lock` identical for everyone else.
CI will never see the directory, so it resolves the same 240 packages with or
without your local copy.

**4. Install locally with `uv pip install`**

```bash
uv pip install -e packages/canvod-myprivatepackage/
```

`uv pip install` is a direct venv install — it does **not** modify
`pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`.
After a fresh `uv sync`, re-run the command to restore your local install.

### Upgrade path

When the package is ready to become public:

1. Remove it from `.gitignore` and from the `exclude` list.
2. Commit the package directory.
3. Run `uv lock` and commit the updated `uv.lock`.

It becomes a first-class workspace member and appears in the lock for everyone.

### Why not git submodules?

You could also host the private package in its own repository and add it as a
git submodule.  `actions/checkout@v4` does not initialise submodules by
default, so CI would still see an empty directory.  The trade-off is that the
`uv.lock` would diverge between users who have initialised the submodule and
those who have not, requiring everyone to keep the `exclude` in place anyway.
For a single-developer private add-on the simpler approach above is preferred.

## All Just Commands

```bash
just                     # list all commands
just check               # lint + format + type-check
just test                # run all tests
just sync                # install/update dependencies
just clean               # remove build artifacts
just hooks               # install pre-commit hooks

## Troubleshooting

??? failure "`No module named 'canvod.X'`"
    Run `uv sync` to install/reinstall packages in editable mode.

??? failure "`Command not found: just`"
    Install just: `brew install just` (macOS) or see [contributor-setup](contributor-setup.md).

??? failure "Tests fail after dependency changes"
    ```bash
    uv sync --all-extras
    ```

??? failure "`uv.lock` needs to be updated — CI fails but local works"
    An untracked directory inside `packages/` is being picked up by the
    `packages/*` workspace glob and included in the lock.  CI does not have
    the directory and therefore resolves fewer packages, causing a mismatch.

    Identify the culprit:

    ```bash
    git ls-tree HEAD packages/   # shows only committed packages
    ls packages/                 # shows all local packages (including untracked)
    ```

    Any directory present locally but absent from the `git ls-tree` output is
    the source of the divergence.  Follow the
    [Private or Local Add-on Packages](#private-or-local-add-on-packages)
    pattern to exclude it and regenerate the lock.
