# Development Tooling

canVODpy uses a modern Python toolchain built almost entirely on the [Astral](https://astral.sh/) ecosystem.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :fontawesome-solid-box: &nbsp; **uv**

    ---

    Replaces pip, venv, pip-tools, and twine in a single binary.
    Manages Python versions, virtual environments, dependency resolution,
    and builds.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

-   :fontawesome-solid-broom: &nbsp; **ruff**

    ---

    Linter + formatter in one tool. Implements 700+ rules from flake8,
    pylint, black, and isort at 10–100× their speed.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: astral.sh/ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)

-   :fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass-chart: &nbsp; **ty**

    ---

    Type checker replacing mypy. Early development (alpha) but already
    significantly faster for large codebases.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: docs.astral.sh/ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/)

-   :fontawesome-solid-list-check: &nbsp; **just**

    ---

    Task runner with simpler syntax than Make. All common development
    tasks — test, check, docs, config — are `just <command>` away.

## Core Tools

=== "uv — Package Manager"

    ```bash
    uv sync                  # Install all dependencies (workspace-aware)
    uv add numpy             # Add a runtime dependency
    uv add --dev pytest      # Add a dev dependency
    uv run pytest            # Run in the managed environment
    uv build                 # Build a wheel
    uv publish               # Publish to PyPI
    ```

    `uv sync` resolves `uv.lock` and creates or updates the shared workspace
    `.venv` at the repo root — all 13 packages share a single environment.

    Configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

    ```toml
    [project]
    dependencies = ["numpy>=2.0", "xarray>=2024.0"]

    [dependency-groups]
    dev = ["pytest>=9.0", "ruff>=0.15", "ty>=0.0.44"]
    ```

=== "uv_build — Build Backend"

    Builds wheel and sdist with native namespace package support:

    ```toml
    # packages/canvod-readers/pyproject.toml
    [build-system]
    requires      = ["uv_build>=0.9.17,<0.10.0"]
    build-backend = "uv_build"

    [tool.uv.build-backend]
    module-name = "canvod.readers"   # dot → namespace package
    ```

    All 13 workspace packages use `uv_build` as their build backend.

=== "ruff — Linter + Formatter"

    ```bash
    ruff check .          # Lint
    ruff check . --fix    # Lint with auto-fix
    ruff format .         # Format
    ```

    Configuration (workspace root `pyproject.toml` — inherited by all packages):

    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    line-length = 88
    target-version = "py314"

    [tool.ruff.lint]
    select = ["E", "F", "W", "I", "UP", "B", "RUF"]
    ```

    Philosophy: catch real bugs, enforce consistent formatting, don't fight
    scientists over naming or style. Dropped stylistic rules (N, SIM, C4, PIE, PT)
    that add noise without catching bugs.

=== "ty — Type Checker"

    Type annotations are optional labels on function inputs/outputs — `ty`
    checks that they are consistent, catching a class of bugs before you run
    the code.

    ```bash
    uv run ty check packages/canvod-readers/src/canvod/readers/
    uv run ty check canvodpy/src/canvodpy/
    ```

    Configured at the **workspace root** `pyproject.toml`:

    ```toml
    [tool.ty.environment]
    python-version = "3.14"
    ```

    !!! info "Non-blocking in canVODpy"
        Type checking is **informational and does not block commits or PRs**.
        `ty` runs in CI with `continue-on-error: true`, and errors are tracked
        as a budget ratchet (lowered ~10 per PR). Use `just check-types` to
        view the current diagnostic count.

## Supporting Tools

=== "just — Task Runner"

    Recipes are defined in `justfile` at the repo root. Use `just --list` to
    see all available recipes.

    All common tasks are single commands:

    ```bash
    just test             # Run the full test suite
    just check            # Lint + format + type-check
    just hooks            # Install pre-commit hooks
    just docs             # Preview documentation locally
    just docs-build       # Build static documentation
    just config-init      # Scaffold canvod-settings.yaml from template
    just config-validate  # Validate config files
    just --list           # Show all available commands
    ```

=== "pytest — Testing"

    ```bash
    uv run pytest                        # All tests
    uv run pytest --cov=canvod           # With coverage
    uv run pytest -m "not integration"   # Skip integration tests
    uv run pytest packages/canvod-readers/tests/
    ```

    Integration tests are marked `@pytest.mark.integration`. They are **not**
    excluded by default — pass `-m "not integration"` to skip them for a fast
    unit-only run.

=== "pre-commit — Git Hooks"

    ```bash
    just hooks    # Install hooks (run once after clone)
    ```

    Configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. ruff and ty use `repo: local`
    so pre-commit uses the same versions as the project:

    ```yaml
    repos:
      - repo: local
        hooks:
          - id: ruff-check
            entry: uv run ruff check --fix
            stages: [pre-commit]
          - id: ruff-format
            entry: uv run ruff format
            stages: [pre-commit]
      - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-pre-commit
        hooks:
          - id: uv-lock
            stages: [pre-commit]
      - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
        hooks:
          - id: trailing-whitespace
          - id: check-added-large-files
          - id: detect-private-key
          - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
        hooks:
          - id: commitizen
            stages: [commit-msg]
      - repo: local
        hooks:
          - id: ty-check
            entry: uv run ty check
            stages: [pre-push]
          - id: update-submodules
            entry: just update-submodules
            stages: [post-merge]
    ```

    Ruff, uv-lock, and file hygiene hooks run at the `pre-commit` stage and
    block the commit on failure. Commitizen validates the message at `commit-msg`.
    `ty-check` runs at the **`pre-push` stage** (not on every commit), so type
    errors surface before reaching the remote but without slowing down local commits.
    `update-submodules` runs at `post-merge`.

=== "Conventional Commits"

    Commits must follow the format `type: short description` where `type` is
    one of `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, or `refactor`. commitizen validates
    this at the `commit-msg` git hook stage and blocks non-conforming messages.
    This powers the automated changelog.

    ```
    feat: add Fibonacci grid tessellation       ✅
    fix(store): handle empty metadata table     ✅
    docs(aux): clarify SP3 interpolation        ✅
    added new grid                              ❌  (no type prefix)
    ```

    Monorepo scopes (optional but encouraged): `readers`, `aux`, `grids`, `vod`,
    `store`, `viz`, `utils`, `naming`, `orchestrator`, `diagnostics`, `ops`,
    `ci`, `docs`, `deps`.

=== "Zensical + beautiful-mermaid"

    Documentation is built with [Zensical](https://zensical.dev/), a
    Rust+Python wrapper around MkDocs Material:

    ```bash
    just docs          # Preview locally (wraps uv run zensical serve --open)
    just docs-build    # Build static site (wraps uv run zensical build)
    ```

    Mermaid diagram sources live in `docs/diagrams/` as `.mmd` files.
    Render them to SVG/PNG using beautiful-mermaid:

    ```bash
    npx beautiful-mermaid render docs/diagrams/<file.mmd>
    ```

    Do not commit generated images (`*.png`, `*.svg`).
