# Get Started Retrieving VOD

**The CLI is the main way to use canVODpy** — a complete, terminal-first
entrypoint designed to run unattended: cron jobs, HPC/remote machines,
scheduled batch processing. Most users should start there, even if they
plan to wrap it in their own scripts later.

From Python, `Site.pipeline()` runs the same processing for scripted or
notebook-driven runs and gives the same results.

    The recommended entrypoint for production runs, cron jobs, and remote/HPC
    deployments. Complete on its own — no Python required.

    `Site.pipeline()` for scripted/notebook-driven runs, with the same
    results as the CLI.

Both paths share the same installation and the same `canvod-settings.yaml`
configuration file — see whichever guide you pick for the full walkthrough.
