## Current Status Estimate

Based on canvodpy's current state:

### ✅ Already Passing (Estimated: ~70%)

**Basics:**
- ✅ Website with basic project info
- ✅ Clear description (README.md)
- ✅ OSI-approved license (Apache 2.0)
- ✅ Public version control (GitHub)
- ✅ Issue tracking (GitHub Issues)
- ✅ Distributed version control (Git)

**Change Control:**
- ✅ Semantic versioning
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Release process (release.yml)
- ✅ Individual commit messages

**Quality:**
- ✅ Coding standards (ruff with 50+ rule sets, PEP 8 compliant)
- ✅ Type checking (ty with type budget enforcement)
- ✅ Test suite (pytest with 8 test workflows)
- ✅ Test coverage (test_coverage.yml)
- ✅ CI/CD (8 workflows: tests, coverage, code quality, audit, FAIR, releases)
- ✅ Reproducible builds (uv.lock with pinned dependencies)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (ruff, ty, conventional commits)

**Security:**
- ✅ Vulnerability disclosure (SECURITY.md) ✨ New!
- ✅ Dependency updates (Dependabot + uv.lock)
- ✅ Static analysis (ruff linting + audit.yml)
- ✅ Type safety (ty type checker)
- ✅ OpenSSF Scorecard (scorecard.yml) ✨ New!

### 📝 Needs Documentation

**Basics:**
- [ ] Document how to obtain help (add to CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Roadmap or project plans (could add to docs)

**Security:**
- [ ] Document that key developers know secure coding practices
- [ ] Document secure delivery method (signed releases, checksums)
- [ ] Document how to verify downloaded software

**Analysis:**
- [ ] Document static analysis tools used
- [ ] Document dynamic analysis results

### ⚙️ Needs Implementation

**Security:**
- [ ] Enable GitHub security advisories
- [ ] Add SPDX license identifiers to all source files (have REUSE.toml, need to verify)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication for all committers
- [ ] Signed releases (GPG/Sigstore)

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

### 1. Enable GitHub Security Features
```bash
# In GitHub repo settings:
Settings → Security → Enable:
  - Dependabot alerts ✓ (already enabled)
  - Dependabot security updates ✓
  - Code scanning alerts (via scorecard.yml) ✓
  - Secret scanning
```

### 2. Add Security Documentation to CONTRIBUTING.md
Add a section referencing SECURITY.md and secure coding practices.

### 3. Create SECURITY_PRACTICES.md
Document that developers follow secure coding practices:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Dependency management
- Code review process

### 4. Verify REUSE Compliance
```bash
cd /Users/work/Developer/GNSS/canvodpy
uv run reuse lint
```

### 5. Add Release Verification
- Generate checksums for releases (SHA256)
- Consider signing releases with GPG or Sigstore

## Application Process Timeline

1. **Week 1:** Fill out questionnaire (~2-3 hours)
2. **Week 2:** Address gaps (documentation, process improvements)
3. **Week 3:** Request badge review
4. **Week 4:** Respond to reviewer feedback
5. **Week 5:** Receive badge 🎉

## Maintaining the Badge

Once obtained, you must:
- Update badge status annually
- Keep criteria met as project evolves
- Document new security practices

## Resources

- **Badge Criteria:** https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/criteria
- **Getting Started Guide:** https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1
- **Examples:** Search GitHub for "best practices badge" to see other projects

## Next Steps

1. **Create account** at bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org
2. **Add canvodpy project**
3. **Start questionnaire** (save progress frequently)
4. **Address gaps** from "Needs Documentation" and "Needs Implementation" sections above
5. **Request review** once you're at 100%
6. **Add badge to README** once approved

## Badge Markdown (Add After Approval)

```markdown
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/XXXXX/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/XXXXX)
```

Replace `XXXXX` with your project ID from the badge system.
