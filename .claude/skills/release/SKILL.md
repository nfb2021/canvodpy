# Release canvodpy

All packages of this repository carry the same version and are released
together under the tag `v<version>`. The long form, with troubleshooting,
is `docs/RELEASING.md`. Tags, GitHub Releases and PyPI uploads are public
and permanent: confirm the version with the user before tagging and again
before publishing to PyPI.

## Before

- Submodule pointers (`demo`, `packages/canvod-readers/tests/test_data`)
  point at the commits meant for this release.
- canvod-filemap is taken from a tag or commit of canvodpy-extensions, not
  a branch (root `pyproject.toml`, see the `extensions-dependency` guide).
- Deprecated code stays in every 1.x release; v2.0.0 removes it.
- `just check` and `just test` pass on the release branch.
- The working tree is clean (`git status`): `just release` commits with
  `git add .`, so stray changes would land in the release commit.

## Steps

1. On a release branch: `just release X.Y.Z`. It runs the tests, writes the
   changelog, bumps every package (`just bump`) and creates a local tag.
   Follow the steps it prints: delete the local tag, open a PR for the
   commit, merge it.
2. On the merged `main`, recreate the annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` and push it
   (after the user confirms). GitHub Actions drafts the GitHub Release;
   the user publishes it.
3. PyPI is a separate, manual step the user triggers:
   `gh workflow run publish_pypi.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f version=X.Y.Z`.
4. Afterwards canvodpy-extensions takes the new version from PyPI (their
   `canvodpy-dependency` guide).
