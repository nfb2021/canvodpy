# Deprecate code

Deprecated code keeps working in every 1.x release and is removed in
v2.0.0. Delete code outright only when the user says so.

## 1. Find every user of it

```bash
just graph-affected <name>
```

Also search the demo notebooks (`demo/`), the docs (`docs/`) and
canvodpy-extensions. Move canvodpy's own callers to the replacement first;
nothing in a run may still call deprecated code.

## 2. Mark it

Use the one decorator, `deprecated` from
`packages/canvod-utils/src/canvod/utils/tools/deprecation.py`
(`from canvod.utils.tools import deprecated`). It emits `FutureWarning`,
which Python shows by default. A package that uses it lists canvod-utils
as a dependency.

The message says three things, in words a scientist understands:

```python
@deprecated(
    "`check_rinex` is left over from development and will be removed with "
    "the next major version. Use `check_day` instead."
)
```

1. it is left over from development (or why it is wrong, if it gives
   different results),
2. it will be removed with the next major version,
3. what to use instead.

A deprecated argument warns inside the function when it is passed. A
deprecated module says so in its docstring and warns on use.

## 3. Same PR

- A test that the warning fires and that the old name still works
  (delegating to the replacement where possible).
- Docs: mark it deprecated where it is described, teach the replacement.
- The `AGENTS.md` of the package, if it names the code.
- Commit: `refactor(<scope>): deprecate <name>, use <replacement>`.
