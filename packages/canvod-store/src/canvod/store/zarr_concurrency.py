"""Shared zarr async-concurrency scoping (dev/todo_later.md §44).

Zarr v3's async codec pipeline issues chunk writes/reads for a single array
as a concurrent ``asyncio.gather`` burst, sized by ``zarr.config``'s
``async.concurrency`` (default 10). On network-mounted (CIFS/NFS) stores
that burst can trip connection-abort errors under load. Capping it costs
throughput, so every caller opts in explicitly via its own config knob
(``IcechunkConfig.zarr_async_concurrency``, ``AuxDataConfig.zarr_async_concurrency``)
rather than this helper choosing a default.

Extracted out of ``MyIcechunkStore`` so the aux (SP3/CLK Hermite) cache's
plain-Zarr write path -- a separate store, untouched by the Icechunk-only
fix that originally shipped this -- can use the exact same mechanism.

# concurrently (e.g. canvodpy's cross-group forked writes) could interleave
# out of stack order and restore each other's scoped value mid-write. This
# lock serializes only this small config-mutation+write critical section, not

    ``concurrency=None`` is a no-op (zarr's own default applies, unchanged).
    Otherwise reads the current ``async`` config subsection and merges the
    new concurrency value onto it before scoping -- ``zarr.config.set()``
    replaces the whole subsection rather than merging, so passing only
    ``{"concurrency": ...}`` would silently drop sibling keys (e.g.
    ``timeout``) for the scope of the block. This crashed a production run
    with ``KeyError: 'timeout'`` the first time this mistake was made; do
    not reintroduce it.

    Thread-safe: serializes concurrent callers via ``_zarr_config_scope_lock``
    so interleaved enter/exit from multiple threads can't corrupt each
    other's scoped value (see module docstring). The lock is reentrant
    (``RLock``) because this context manager nests on a single thread today
    (see ``test_nested_scoping_reverts_to_the_outer_value``) -- a plain
    ``Lock`` here deadlocks the inner call against its own thread's outer
