"""Tests for the shared zarr async-concurrency scoping helper.

Extracted from MyIcechunkStore's icechunk-only throttle so the aux
(SP3/CLK Hermite) cache's plain-Zarr write path can share the exact same
mechanism (dev/todo_later.md §44). MyIcechunkStore's own behavior is
covered by test_write_concurrency_cap.py and is unaffected by this
extraction (verified there, unmodified).

    `zarr.config` is a single process-wide donfig singleton;
    `scoped_zarr_concurrency` mutates it via save-on-enter/restore-on-exit.
    Before `_zarr_config_scope_lock` was added, concurrent callers (e.g. one
    thread per receiver group in `RinexDataProcessor._write_group_into_fork`)
    could interleave enter/exit out of stack order and observe -- or restore
    -- each other's scoped value mid-write. The lock forces full
    serialization of the config-mutation+read critical section, so each
    thread's block always sees exactly its own value, no matter how many
    other threads are contending for the same block concurrently.
