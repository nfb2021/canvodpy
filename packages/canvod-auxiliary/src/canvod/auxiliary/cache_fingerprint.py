"""Fingerprinting for the network-wide aux (SP3/CLK Hermite) cache.

See dev/todo_later.md §44. The aux cache is keyed by a fingerprint that is
deliberately site-independent -- ephemeris products are satellite-based, not
site-based, so the same fingerprint should hit for every site sharing the
same agency/product/ephemeris-source config on the same date, regardless of
which site's pipeline run happens to populate it first.
