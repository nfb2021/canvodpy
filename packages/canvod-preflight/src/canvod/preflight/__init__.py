"""canvod-preflight: the canVOD filename convention.

``CanVODFilename`` parses and builds canonical canVOD filenames, and
``find_overlaps`` finds files whose named time spans overlap. Both are used
by the file discovery of ``canvodpy run``.

.. deprecated::
    The mapping and validation API (``FilenameMapper``, ``VirtualFile``,
    ``DataDirectoryValidator``, ``ValidationReport``, ``SiteNamingConfig``,
    ``ReceiverNamingConfig``, ``DirectoryLayout``, the pattern registry and
    the ``canvod-preflight`` command) is left over from development
    and will be removed with the next major version. Use naming recipes
    (``canvod-filemap``) and ``canvodpy config validate`` instead.
