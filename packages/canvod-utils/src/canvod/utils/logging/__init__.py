"""Logging helpers shared by the canvod packages.

The packages log through structlog: every module gets its logger with
``structlog.get_logger(__name__)``. The output (console, log files) is
configured by ``canvodpy.logging.configure_logging``; a package used without
canvodpy logs through structlog's defaults.

- :mod:`~canvod.utils.logging.run_context`: the run identifier added to every
  log record and Icechunk commit message of a run.
- :mod:`~canvod.utils.logging.stage_timer`: timing of the processing stages
  and the end-of-run summary.
