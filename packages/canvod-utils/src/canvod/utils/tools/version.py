def get_version_from_pyproject(pyproject_path: Path | None = None) -> str:
    """
    Get the installed canvod-utils package version.

    Tries `importlib.metadata` first, which resolves correctly for any
    install type (wheel, sdist, or editable). Falls back to walking up
    from this file's location looking for a `pyproject.toml` -- this only
    ever succeeds inside an editable/dev source checkout, since a built
    wheel's site-packages never ships pyproject.toml. Without the
    importlib.metadata path first, every store write from a non-editable
    install (a real PyPI release, or a git-sourced install like the demo
    notebooks use) raised FileNotFoundError here, since callers pass no
    explicit pyproject_path and expect this to just work.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pyproject_path : Path, optional
        Path to pyproject.toml. If None, resolved automatically as
        described above.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Version string.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> version = get_version_from_pyproject()
    >>> print(version)  # e.g., "0.1.0"
