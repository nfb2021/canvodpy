# canvod-ops

Composable preprocessing operations pipeline for GNSS-Transmissometry.

Part of the [canVODpy](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy) ecosystem.

## Overview

`canvod-ops` provides a modular `Op`-based pipeline for applying preprocessing
steps to GNSS datasets. Operations are composable and chainable via `Pipeline`.

## Key components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Op` | Abstract base class for all operations |
| `GridAssignment` | Assigns satellite observations to equal-area grid cells |
| `Pipeline` | Chains operations and returns `PipelineResult` |

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install canvod-ops
```

## Configuration (optional)

`build_default_pipeline()` falls back to `PreprocessingConfig()` defaults when
no config is found — `canvod-config`'s `load_config()` is only consulted if
available. In a standalone install outside a canvodpy monorepo checkout,
point it at a settings file with:

- `CANVOD_CONFIG_DIR` — directory containing `canvod-settings.yaml`
- `CANVOD_CONFIG_FILE` — an overlay YAML file merged on top

## Quick Start

```python
from canvod.ops import Pipeline, GridAssignment

grid = create_hemigrid(grid_type="equal_area", resolution=2.0)
pipeline = Pipeline([GridAssignment(grid)])
result = pipeline.run(ds)
```
