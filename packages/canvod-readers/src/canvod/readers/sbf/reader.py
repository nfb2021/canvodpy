"""SBF file reader.

Wraps the ``sbf-parser`` library and decodes Septentrio Binary Format files
following the AsteRx SB3 ProBase Firmware v4.14.0 Reference Guide
(RefGuide-4.14.0). One decoder serves every output of :class:`SbfReader`:

- Blocks are grouped by their receiver time stamp (TOW, WNc): all blocks of
  a group hold data of the same epoch (RefGuide-4.14.0, Section 4.1.3,
  p.253), whatever their order in the file. The receiver writes the
  MeasExtra, SatVisibility, PVT, DOP and status blocks of an epoch after its
  MeasEpoch block.
- GLONASS FDMA carrier frequencies come from the frequency number in the
  ObsInfo field of the MeasEpoch Type1 sub-block (p.262).
- Observations of SVID 62, a GLONASS satellite whose slot number is not
  known (p.255), are dropped: they have no RINEX satellite code, and several
  such satellites would share one identifier.
- The raw fields of all observations are scaled at once with the functions
  in :mod:`canvod.readers.sbf._scaling`.
